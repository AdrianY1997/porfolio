          <p>Hi!</p>
          <p>
            My name is Adrian Mauricio Arandia Urrea. I am a
            <b> software programming technician</b> graduated from SENA and I am
            currently studying
            <b>Technology in Software Analysis and Development</b> at the same
            institute. I work in both front-end and back-end web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I do not have professional experience yet, but I am very
            excited for you to see the projects where I practice my knowledge
            and skills.
          </p>
